# pylnlib
A python library to monitor LocoNet traffic on a usb/serial bus.

# intro
I am automating my layout with several Digikeijs components (DR5000, DR4024, DR4088) and I want to be able to script part of the running operation.

Now JMRI works fine and even allows for Python scripting, but I find it a bit top heavy on a RaspberryPi 3B+ and also, although this may be a matter of taste, the Python bindings are not very pythonic nor very logical IMHO.

Still, a lot of effort went into JMRI and otherwise it is a fine piece of software, but writing my own LocoNet Python library from scratch is not only a nice personal learning experience, but also might allow me to move some of it to microcontrollers with micro Python.
